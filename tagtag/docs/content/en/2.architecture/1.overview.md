# Architecture Overview

Tagtag adopts a modern architecture with separation of frontend and backend. The frontend handles user interaction and interface display, while the backend is responsible for business logic and data processing.

## Overall Architecture

The Tagtag system consists of two main parts:

- **Frontend**: Located in the `tagtag-ui` directory. A modern Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript, adopting the Vben Admin 5 framework, and using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for interface development.
- **Backend**: Multiple Java modules located in the root directory. A modular application built with Spring Boot, responsible for providing RESTful APIs and data persistence services.

### Interaction

- **Protocol**: Frontend and backend communicate via HTTP/HTTPS protocol using RESTful API style.
- **Data Format**: JSON is used as the standard data exchange format.
- **Authentication**: Stateless authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).

## Backend Architecture

Tagtag backend follows a strict multi-module architecture to separate infrastructure, business logic, and API definitions.

### Backend Layered Design

The backend project is organized into the following layers:

#### 1. Common Layer (`tagtag-common`)
Pure utility classes with **no Spring dependencies**.
- Constants
- Exceptions
- Base Models (PageResult, Result)
- Utils (BeanUtils, StringUtils)

#### 2. Framework Layer (`tagtag-framework`)
Infrastructure integration. This layer depends on Spring Boot and other third-party libraries.
- MyBatis Plus Configuration
- Redis Configuration
- Spring Security & JWT
- Global Exception Handling
- Aspect definitions (Log, RateLimit)

#### 3. Kernel Layer (`tagtag-kernel`)
Core business support logic.
- Annotations (`@OperationLog`, `@DataPermission`)
- Enums (Status, Gender)
- User Context Holder

#### 4. Contract Layer (`tagtag-contract`)
Defines the interface between modules.
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects used for API input/output.
- **API Interfaces**: Java interfaces defining the service contracts.

#### 5. Module Layer (`tagtag-module`)
The actual business implementation.
- Controllers
- Service Implementations
- Entity classes (mapped to Database)
- Mappers

#### 6. Start Layer (`tagtag-start`)
The application entry point. Aggregates all modules and provides configuration files (`application.yml`).

## Frontend Architecture

Tagtag frontend adopts a Monorepo structure, built on **Vben Admin 5**.

### Core Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **Routing**: Vue Router
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (Monorepo Workspace)

### Module Division

The frontend project is mainly divided into the application layer (`apps`) and the core package layer (`packages`), sharing code and managing dependencies via Monorepo.
