Tagtag framework fully supports AI-assisted development through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration and AI-friendly documentation, enabling you to leverage AI tools to accelerate your development workflow.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to external data sources and tools. Through MCP, AI can directly access your project documentation, codebase, and other resources, providing more accurate and relevant assistance.

## Tagtag's AI Support Features

### 1. AI-Friendly Documentation

Tagtag's official documentation has integrated the `nuxt-llms` module to automatically generate AI-readable documentation files:

- **llms.txt**: Concise structured documentation optimized for AI to quickly understand the project
- **llms-full.txt**: Complete detailed documentation providing in-depth project information

Access URLs:
- http://tagtag.cn/llms.txt
- http://tagtag.cn/llms-full.txt

These documents follow the llms.txt standard and can be directly read and parsed by various AI tools and MCP servers.

### 2. MCP Tool Integration

Tagtag documentation site has configured `@nuxtjs/mcp-toolkit`, providing standard MCP tool interfaces that allow AI assistants to directly access and query documentation content.

## Using AI-Assisted Development in Trae

### Step 1: Configure MCP Server

In Trae, you need to configure an MCP server to connect to Tagtag's documentation resources.

#### MCP Configuration Example

Create or edit your MCP configuration file (usually in the user configuration directory):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tagtag-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "http://tagtag.cn/llms.txt"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Enable MCP in Trae

1. Open Trae settings
2. Navigate to "AI" or "MCP" configuration section
3. Add Tagtag documentation MCP server configuration
4. Save and restart Trae

### Step 3: Use AI Assistant

Once configured, you can use the AI assistant in Trae:

```typescript
// Example: Ask AI how to create a new CRUD module
"Please help me create a user management module with CRUD functionality"
```

AI will automatically access Tagtag documentation, understand the framework structure, and provide accurate code examples and guidance.

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Quick CRUD Code Generation

```typescript
// Ask AI
"Based on the Tagtag framework, help me generate a product management CRUD module including:
- Product entity class
- Mapper interface
- Service layer
- Controller layer
- Frontend pages"
```

AI will reference Tagtag's code standards and best practices to generate code that conforms to framework standards.

### 2. Query API Documentation

```typescript
// Ask AI
"How is the RBAC permission system implemented in Tagtag?"
```

AI will extract relevant information from the documentation and provide detailed explanations and code examples.

### 3. Code Review and Optimization

```typescript
// Ask AI
"Please review this code to see if it follows Tagtag development standards"
```

AI will provide improvement suggestions based on Tagtag's code style guidelines.

### 4. Troubleshooting

```typescript
// Ask AI
"I encountered an issue while using Tagtag's file storage feature. The error message is..."
```

AI will help you quickly identify and resolve issues by combining documentation with common problems.

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Clear Context

When asking AI questions, provide sufficient context information:

```typescript
// Good question
"In the Tagtag framework, I need to create a new module 'order' with order management functionality.
Please reference the existing 'user' module structure and generate corresponding code."

// Bad question
"Help me write an order module"
```

### 2. Ask Step by Step

For complex tasks, break them down into multiple small steps:

```typescript
// Step 1
"Help me create an Order entity class with fields like id, userId, amount, status"

// Step 2
"Based on the Order entity, create the corresponding Mapper interface"

// Step 3
"Create OrderService interface and implementation class"
```

### 3. Verify Generated Code

AI-generated code requires human review and testing:

- Check if it follows project standards
- Run unit tests
- Perform integration testing
- Code review

### 4. Continuous Learning

Through AI-assisted development, you can:

- Learn framework best practices
- Understand complex architecture designs
- Master new development techniques
- Improve code quality

## Advanced Usage

### Custom MCP Tools

If you need to extend MCP functionality, you can add custom tools in the Tagtag project:

```typescript
// server/mcp/tools/custom-tools.ts
export default defineMCPTool({
  name: 'tagtag-code-generator',
  description: 'Generate Tagtag module code',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      moduleName: {
        type: 'string',
        description: 'Module name'
      }
    }
  },
  handler: async (input) => {
    // Custom code generation logic
    return {
      success: true,
      data: 'Generated code...'
    }
  }
})
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Integrate AI-assisted development into your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-review.yml
name: AI Code Review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: AI Review
        run: |
          npx @modelcontextprotocol/cli review \
            --docs http://tagtag.cn/llms.txt
```

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use AI-generated code directly?

A: Not recommended. AI-generated code needs to be manually reviewed, tested, and optimized to ensure it meets project standards and business requirements.

### Q: How can I improve AI response quality?

A: Provide clear, specific context information, reference Tagtag documentation structure, and use framework terminology. This way, AI can provide more accurate answers.

### Q: What should I do if MCP server connection fails?

A: Check network connection, ensure documentation URL is accessible, review MCP server logs, and verify configuration is correct.

### Q: Can I use AI-assisted development offline?

A: Yes. You can download the llms.txt file locally, configure a local MCP server, and achieve offline access.
