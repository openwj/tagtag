title: System Module
description: System configuration and monitoring.
---

The **System** module manages global configuration, dictionary data, log monitoring, and file storage services.

## Features

### 1. Dictionary Management (Dict)
Dynamically manages system-wide constants and enumeration values, reducing hardcoding in the frontend.
- **Structure**: Dictionary Type (Type) -> Dictionary Data (Data).
- **Example**: `sys_user_sex` (User Gender) -> `1:Male`, `2:Female`.
- **Cache**: Supports Redis caching to improve read performance.

### 2. Operation Logs
Records critical user operational behaviors for auditing and tracking.
- **Implementation**: Automatically captured via the `@OperationLog` annotation.
- **Content**: Records operator, module, method, IP address, operation time, execution result, duration, etc.
- **Query**: Supports retrieval by time, module, and user.

### 3. System Config (Config) (Planned)
Manages dynamic parameters for system runtime.
- **Example**: Site title, file upload size limit, default password, etc.

### 4. File Storage (Storage)
Provides unified file upload and management capabilities.
- **Supported Modes**:
    - **Local Storage**: Files are saved on the server disk.
    - **Object Storage (OSS)**: Integration with Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, MinIO, etc. (requires corresponding plugins).
- **Features**: File upload, download, preview, delete.

## Frontend Implementation

Frontend code is located at `tagtag-ui/apps/tagtag/src/views/modules`.
