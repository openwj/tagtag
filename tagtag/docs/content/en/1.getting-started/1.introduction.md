# Introduction

Tagtag is a generic, modular admin backend framework built with Java and Spring Boot 3. It is designed to provide a lightweight and solid foundation for building business applications.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The system is split into multiple modules (`common`, `framework`, `module`, etc.), ensuring clear structure and maintainability.
- **Contract-First Design**: API definitions are separated from implementations using `contract` modules, standardizing the code structure.
- **Essential Capabilities**: Built-in support for RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), Operation Logs, and Rate Limiting.
- **Modern Stack**: Built on Spring Boot 3, MyBatis Plus, and Redis.

## Why Tagtag?

Among the myriad of admin frameworks, Tagtag has a clear positioning: **The best starting scaffold for new projects**. We don't aim for complex, all-encompassing features, but focus on providing a **simple, easy-to-use** development foundation.

### 1. Simplicity & Quick Start
- **No Over-Engineering**: No burden of complex microservice architectures, no hard-to-understand abstraction layers. Tagtag keeps the code pure and intuitive, allowing you to run the project in minutes, not days.
- **The Best Choice for New Projects**: When you need to start a new admin project, Tagtag offers the purest starting point. It doesn't come pre-loaded with tons of redundant code, letting you travel light and focus on implementing business logic.

### 2. Essential Features Only
- **Just What You Need**: We only include the essential features that almost every admin system requires—User Management, Role/Permission Configuration, and Operation Logs.
- **No Complex Integrations**: No pre-installed pile of middleware and third-party libraries that you might never use. Keeping the codebase light means lower maintenance costs and reduced risk of dependency conflicts.

### 3. Clean Code Structure
- **Easy to Understand & Extend**: Based on the standard Spring Boot structure combined with modular design, the code logic is clear at a glance. Even junior developers can quickly understand and start developing, making it easy for teams to customize.
- **Standardized Development**: Built-in unified response encapsulation, exception handling, and logging standards establish a standardized development template for team collaboration.

### 4. Modern Tech Stack
- **Spring Boot 3 & Vue 3**: While pursuing simplicity, we are not conservative in our tech stack. The backend is based on Spring Boot 3 + JDK 17, and the frontend on Vben Admin 5 (Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite), ensuring you enjoy the performance improvements and developer experience of the latest technologies.

### 5. Flexible Modular Extension
- **Extension on Demand**: Thanks to the clear module division (`module` layer), adding new business functions only requires creating a new Maven module without polluting existing core code.
- **Plug and Play**: Modules have distinct responsibilities and low coupling. Whether integrating new third-party services or splitting existing business logic, the modular design makes extension effortless.
