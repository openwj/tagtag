description: Tagtag Admin Framework - A lightweight, modular admin backend framework built with Java and Spring Boot 3.
---

Tagtag is a general-purpose, modular admin backend framework built with Java and Spring Boot 3. It aims to provide a lightweight and solid foundation for building business applications, helping developers quickly build high-quality admin management systems.

Tagtag has a clear positioning: **The best starting scaffold for new projects**. We don't aim for complex, all-encompassing features, but focus on providing a **simple, easy-to-use** development foundation, allowing developers to focus on implementing business logic.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The system is split into multiple clearly defined modules (`common`, `framework`, `kernel`, `contract`, `module`, etc.), ensuring clear structure and maintainability.
- **Contract-First Design**: API definitions are separated from implementations using `contract` modules, standardizing the code structure and facilitating frontend-backend collaboration and interface management.
- **Comprehensive Permission System**: Built-in RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permission management system, supporting menu permissions, button permissions, and data permissions.
- **Rich Core Functionality**: Built-in operation logs, API rate limiting, dictionary management, file storage, and other core features to meet the needs of most admin systems.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Backend built on Spring Boot 3, MyBatis Plus, and Redis; frontend built on Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite, adopting the Vben Admin 5 framework.
- **Flexible Extension Mechanism**: Modular design allows adding new business functions by simply creating a new Maven module, without polluting existing core code.

## Why Tagtag?

Among the myriad of admin frameworks, Tagtag has the following unique advantages:

### 1. Ultimate Simplicity, Quick Start
- **No Over-Engineering**: No burden of complex microservice architectures, no hard-to-understand abstraction layers. Tagtag keeps the code pure and intuitive, allowing you to run the project in minutes, not days.
- **Best Choice for New Projects**: When you need to start a new admin project, Tagtag offers the purest starting point. It doesn't come pre-loaded with tons of redundant code, letting you travel light and focus on implementing business logic.
- **Clear Documentation**: Provides complete, clear documentation to help developers quickly get started and deeply understand the framework.

### 2. Essential Features Only
- **Just What You Need**: We only include the essential features that almost every admin system requires—User Management, Role/Permission Configuration, Menu Management, Operation Logs, API Rate Limiting, Dictionary Management, and File Storage.
- **No Complex Integrations**: No pre-installed pile of middleware and third-party libraries that you might never use. Keeping the codebase light means lower maintenance costs and reduced risk of dependency conflicts.
- **Extension on Demand**: You can easily extend new feature modules according to project requirements.

### 3. Clean Code Structure
- **Easy to Understand & Extend**: Based on the standard Spring Boot structure combined with modular design, the code logic is clear at a glance. Even junior developers can quickly understand and start developing, making it easy for teams to customize.
- **Standardized Development**: Built-in unified response encapsulation, exception handling, and logging standards establish a standardized development template for team collaboration.
- **Excellent Code Quality**: Follows strict code standards, with clear code structure and comprehensive comments, facilitating maintenance and extension.

### 4. Modern Tech Stack
- **Backend Tech Stack**: Built on Spring Boot 3 + JDK 17, integrating MyBatis Plus, Redis, Spring Security, JWT, and other mainstream technologies.
- **Frontend Tech Stack**: Built on Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite, adopting the Vben Admin 5 framework, using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for interface development.
- **Continuous Updates**: We continuously follow and adopt the latest tech stack to ensure the framework remains modern.

### 5. Flexible Modular Extension
- **Extension on Demand**: Thanks to the clear module division, adding new business functions only requires creating a new Maven module without polluting existing core code.
- **Plug and Play**: Modules have distinct responsibilities and low coupling. Whether integrating new third-party services or splitting existing business logic, the modular design makes extension effortless.
- **Loose Coupling Design**: Modules communicate through the contract layer, reducing dependencies between modules and improving the system's flexibility and maintainability.

## Use Cases

Tagtag is suitable for the following types of projects:

- **Enterprise Internal Management Systems**: Such as CRM, ERP, OA, and other enterprise internal management systems
- **SaaS Platforms**: Suitable for building multi-tenant SaaS platform admin systems
- **E-commerce Backends**: Suitable for building e-commerce platform admin systems
- **Content Management Systems**: Suitable for building various content management systems
- **API Management Platforms**: Suitable for building API management and monitoring platforms
- **Other Admin Systems**: Suitable for building various types of admin management systems

Tagtag is not suitable for the following types of projects:

- **High-concurrency, High-traffic Internet Applications**: Such as social networks, live streaming platforms, etc.
- **Complex Microservice Architecture Projects**: If your project requires a complex microservice architecture, Tagtag may not be the best choice
- **Projects Requiring Extensive Custom UI**: If you need highly customized UI design, you may need to make significant modifications to the frontend code
